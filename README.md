# Linear-Regression-with-Numpy
Implementing a basic linear regression model with numpy operations only. 

Here is this implementation compared with sklearn on a graph generated by uniformly generating 200 points from 0 to 20 and adding noise to each taken from a normal distribution with mean 0 and std=10.
